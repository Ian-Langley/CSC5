In Munchkin, you're a fantasy hero kicking down doors in a dungeon, looking for monsters to bash and Treasures to grab. 
You level up each time you kill a monster. 
Reach Level 10, and you win! 
But watch out â€“ other players mights stab you in the back at any moment!

On your turn, you kick down the door by drawing and revealing the top Door card. 
Compare your Level and bonuses against the monster; if your total is bigger or equal, you win!
The fight isn't over until you decide to Run Away.
